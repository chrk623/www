I've always wanted to start a personal website for showing my CV, sharing my research and other interesting things.

Anyways, I quickly decided that I would want to use **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** and **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** to create the website for future-proofing and **markdown** for the posts. Conveniently, there is a template on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) for this, so.. lets go!
