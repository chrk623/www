## Natural Language Processing in Clinical Trials (2021 - Present)

Supervisor: [Yalu Wen](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/y-wen), [Thomas Yee](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-yee)

By using clinical trials (CT), high quality decisions can be made to benefit the healthcare systems, but it can often become expensive and are prone to failure. With the large amount of clinical data from the past, more modern techniques can be applied to gain inference.
Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are now widely used in different areas like grammar induction and text-to-speed transformation. 
However, NLP is not yet mature in the CT  area. 
It would be beneficial to include NLP techniques to automate certain tasks like processing clinical reports to obtain important information and optimizing trial designs. This could potentially lower the cost and decrease failure rates substantially.

Therefore, we propose to develop:
1. NLP algorithms to learn from and process existing trials
2. algorithms to assess analytical methods to optimize trials
3. algorithms to facilitate decision making

## Visualising Data Wrangling Operations: Joins and Reshaping (2019 - 2020)

Supervisor: [Chris Wild](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/c-wild), [Anna Fergusson](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/a-fergusson) 

In the recent update of [iNZight](https://inzight.nz/), a joining and reshaping module was introduced. This module provides a tool for users to join and reshape data sets. 
Though it is not difficult to apply these operations and obtain the result with a tool like iNZight, there is a lack of tutorials or tools that explain the underlying process of these operations in an easy to understand manner. In this report, why these data operations are useful and important will be discussed. 
Software will also be developed that attempts to teach key concepts associated with joining and reshaping data sets through animations.

## Survey Statistics in SQL (2018 - 2019)

Supervisor: [Thomas Lumley](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-lumley)

Most current software for survey analysis reads the data into memory, however, most of these computations can actually be expressed as database operations. 
The aim of this package is to provide a set of functions which allows survey statistics to be computed directly inside a database. 
To do this, we used [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/). 
Lastly, this package takes a step further, it also provides graphics computation directly inside a database, where data tables are read into memory only when necessary.
